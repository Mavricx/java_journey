# 🚀 Java Journey — My Path Through Java, DSA & LeetCode

A curated collection of Java solutions to LeetCode, DSA problems, and core Java concepts.  
This repository documents my continuous learning journey as I strengthen problem-solving skills, master Java fundamentals, and dive deeper into data structures & algorithms.

## 🎯 **Purpose of This Repository**

Most people assume solving random problems is enough to “learn DSA”—but real progress happens only when solutions are **organized, explained, and revisited**.  
This repository helps me:

- Build consistency in problem-solving  
- Understand patterns behind algorithms  
- Improve Java proficiency through real examples  
- Track progression across easy → medium → hard problems  
- Document concepts I’ve learned for revision
