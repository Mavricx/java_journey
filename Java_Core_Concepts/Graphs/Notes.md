# Graph

- Network of nodes.

## Edges can be

1. Uni-directional
2. Un-directed
3. Bi-directional

### If we take edges into consideration

1. Weighted
2. Un-weighted

## Storing the Graph /Representation of Graph.

1. Adjacency List(List of Lists)[can be stored as ArrayList<ArrayList>,Array <ArrayList>, or hashmap<vertex, value>]
   Optimal Approach
   Array of ArrayList <Edges> --> 1.source 2.destination 3.weight of edge
2. Adjacency Matrix
3. Edge List(consist of pairs, each pair/edge consist of two source of destination node of that edge)
4. 2d Matrix

## Application of Graphs

1. Maps (Shorted Path)
2. Social Networks (Describe the connection between the profiles/person)
3. Delivery Network (shortest cyclic root)
4. Physics and Chemistry(To study molecular structure)
5. For routing algorithm
6. Machine learning (Computation graphs)
7. Dependency Graph
8. Computer Vision(Image segmentation)
9. For Database( Nebula, neo4g)
10. For research Purposes
